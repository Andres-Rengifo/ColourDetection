Personal Project using python and integrating openCV

14/09/23 status:
- imported opencv (only works with python 3.8.8)
- camera works and is utilized (but it's inverted)
- colour tracking

20/09/23 status:
-mouse follows (somewhat) the bbox

problems:
- frame rate drops when colour is detected
- mouse is not precise enough
- camera detects too much background noise (opencv mask)
